# unity-ngui-localize-tools



hi :every body .it's my first commit in github ,so thank you come here and see the code.

so ,let me introduce something about this tool.

in our unity projects, we want to make our progress fast ,so we take some mistakes, the important one is localize .

our ui use NGUI, so in some condition ,we want to make Art effect, so we put on the label with some text without uilocalize.cs, so today we want to produce to other country,so we have to change it ,this small tool is born.



There are Two types of Uilabel in prefabs ,type one is a standard uilable that do not reference by other ,the other one is be referenced by other script .so we want to do is  to distinguish  the uilabel. add the uilocalize.cs to standard one ,and extract the  label in it to save to csv file.

so that's purpose . 


第一次使用github上传资料。东西可能比较简单，主要是在项目中发现一些预设上挂了Uilabel，而这些UILabel 有两种，因此今天花了一天时间，整理下下这些label ,并将这些Label上的字添加到CSV文件里面。
